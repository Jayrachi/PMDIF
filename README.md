# PMDIF
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Interactive Fiction

## What is this?

PMDIF is a narrative-driven game in the Mystery Dungeon universe. It strives to create more great experiences in a world like the one fans know and love. Focusing more on character interactives and a sprawling story, PMDIF doesn't seek to replicate the gameplay from the acclaimed PMD titles or to copy the story, but instead to evoke the same feelings of wonder and excitement that the games can. 

## How can I contribute?

Joining the [discord server](https://discord.gg/KdZEbCk) is the best way to contribute. But even just posting a bug report and testing can be vital to the project. Check out the contribution guidelines if you want to help out!

## Building & Running Locally

Knowing how to do this is crucial for contributors, or if you want to have the game offline, instead of relying on [our website][1]. Make sure to build and test before you submit a PR for review!

1. Clone the Repo (Fork if you want to submit a PR!)

Assuming you already have Git set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/blabel3/PMDIF.git
```

2. Install Ruby and the twee2 gem

If you don't already have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) installed, read that guide. If you have RUby, you almost definitely have Ruby Gems installed too, but if you don't get on it!

Then, run 
```
gem install twee2
```

and you're good to go!

3. Build it 

Just run the build script and done!

```
./build.sh
```
